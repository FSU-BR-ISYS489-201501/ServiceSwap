<p><h2>About Me</h2></p>
<p>Hello my name is Lucas Magalski. I'm from Lansing area, although like most of you i'm currently living in big rapids for school.
 I'm a senior in the CIS program and expect to graduate after next fall semester. As for my experience with PHP and html I have worked on a number of smaller websites
 including the one that the old 489 class used to collaborate.</p>
