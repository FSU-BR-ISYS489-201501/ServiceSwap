<P>
 	I expect to graduate in August of 2015, after I complete my internship. I will be done taking classes in May 2015.

	I want to start off my career in things such as social media marketing. I also will be getting a minor in ecommerce marketing to compliment my bachelors degree and I have really fell in love will marketing. Then move into some database management positions.  Later on I can see myself going into IT consulting. If all goes well I would like to start my own business 

	This semester I am working for a family friends start up company. The company is called Bridges Golf Tour. I am managing/running/ creating social media platforms. Utilizing search engine optimization and being introduced to a couple of financial statements and how the assets side of the business functions.

	For the summer I am looking for an internship in IT and marketing if possible to really see what I want to do.  Living in the Midwest my whole life I want to explore a little bit and look for jobs in Denver and other large cities out west.

	I enjoy learning because it gives me the ability to transfer what I have learned to actually getting my hands dirty and accomplishing a task or project. I am a visual and hands on learner.

	My priorities right now are finishing up school strong, work (Ferris catering), internship, and family. I like all kinds of music besides country! 

	I live a mile from campus in town.
