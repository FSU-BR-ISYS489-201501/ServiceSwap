    My name is Jordan Piepkow and I am looking for Summer internship opportunity's and future employment(all locations considered) . I am a senior at Ferris State University about to earn my undergraduates in Computer Information Systems. I decided to concentrate my learning towards the programming side of my major. I enjoy all types of programming including mobile, web(front and back end) and desktop software.


    The reason I chose CIS as my major is because the world of programming fascinates me. There are hundreds of ways to do things and its up to you to find the best one given the situation. The other reason I chose my major is because I have a passion for learning and in this field of work I will have the great opportunity to be a part of a field that is evolving so fast that every couple of years there are new best practices and languages. I will never be able to be complacent in my career and that's something that will keep me interested for the rest of my life.


    I myself am a very social person and would say I work great with other people. I have no problems with doing speeches or anything along those lines and would say that this is one of my greatest assets. I don't believe that college can teach you to be a great programmer, I more believe they teach you how to teach yourself and react to real world scenarios.


    I like most people have favorite languages and languages I am better at in general. My school primarily taught Java, php and MySql but I ventured far out of those bounds in my own learning. I have done work in Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Python, GO, Android(java + android syntax) and a couple different javascript frameworks. I would have to say the language I am most proficient in is Java because its what I have been working with the longest but I would say my best strength is being able to adapt and pick up a language quickly.I have taken various elective classes in Graphics design to go over web aesthetics and typology.
