  <p>My bio:</p>
  
  <p>I am Kevin as you all know by now. I am a senior here at Ferris State but will be returning next year to finish my degree.<br> 
  I grew up in a very small town that I bet none of you have heard of it, Hale. It is in Iosco county which is about three and a half hours north of Ferris.</p> <br>
  I enjoy many things that include the outdoors such as hunting, fishing, mountain bike riding, etc. If it involves the wheels, water, or a rifle, you can count me in. <br>
  Photography is a side hobby of mine when I am not tinkering with electronics or vehicles. As you can see below! <br>
  I was enlisted in the Army and plan to re enlist after I graduate!<br>
