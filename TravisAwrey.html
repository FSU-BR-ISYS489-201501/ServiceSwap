	Hello, my name is Travis Awrey. I am the lead developer for team 2. 
	This is my final semester in the Computer Information Systems program. 
	Originally, I am from Crystal Lake, Illinois, but have lived here in Big Rapids for past five years. 
	When it comes to learning, if I can perform a hands on activity, I will retain the material much longer. 
	My hobbies include longboarding, PC gaming, and listening to electronic dance music.
	One day I will reach my life goal of visiting each continent.
